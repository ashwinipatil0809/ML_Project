## 📘 Student Performance Exam Score Prediction

This project predicts a student’s exam score using machine learning based on academic, lifestyle, and personal factors.

The model analyzes inputs such as study hours, attendance, sleep duration, social media usage, mental health rating, and extracurricular activities to estimate exam performance. The goal of this project is to understand how different factors influence student outcomes and to build a data-driven prediction system.

A trained machine learning model is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interactively enter student details and receive predicted exam scores in real time.
